# Advent of Code 2019 (Clojure)

Solutions for (..some at least) [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

These are going to be
- un-documented
- un-optimized
- possibly janky code
- whatever short variable names I want

This is just for fun and no one besides me will read them so I'm going to not worry about all
the proper coding stuff I do at work and just write code that works.  Ugliness is fine.
If you're looking for exemplary Clojure code; look elsewhere.
